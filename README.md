This project contains a bunch of python notebooks for the capstone project. The function of each notebook is clearly indicated by the title. Each notebook contains a spillover network model for a particular period in time for the portfolio under consideration. Instead of placing all the code in a single notebook, multiple notebooks are used to make the code more readable and so that the user can run the notebook of his/her choice in order to study the project.
